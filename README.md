# LEDManager

 ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-iOS%20-lightgray.svg?style=flat)

----
- This application that uses Firebase and Node.js to provide access RaspberryPi LED with iOS App. The application is written Swift 3+ and utilizes the Firebase framework.


## Installation Pi3
- [Install Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
- [Install Vnc](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/get-back-to-my-pi-from-anywhere-with-vnc-connect/)
- [Install Node-Red](https://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi)

## Installation Node.js in Pi3
- **$ mkdir fireled**
- **$ cd fireled**
Use the npm init command to create a package.json file for your application. For more information on how package.json works, see Specifics of npmâ€™s package.json handling.

- **$ npm init**
This command prompts you for a number of things, such as the name and version of your application. For now, you can simply hit RETURN to accept the defaults for most of them, with the following exception:

entry point: (index.js)
Enter app.js, or whatever you want the name of the main file to be. If you want it to be index.js, hit RETURN to accept the suggested default file name.

Now install firebase in the fireled directory and save it in the dependencies list. For example:

- **$ npm install firebase-admin --save**
- **$ npm install -g firebase-tools**
- **$ npm install firebase --save**

### This package is very important
- **$ npm install onoff**
With this package we GPIO access and interrupt detection with Node.js on Linux boards like the Raspberry Pi, C.H.I.P.

- Under the fireled directory there are two files app.js and package.json. Move to copy these files your fireled directory.
- **$ npm install**
- You have to update line 11 and line 15.


## Setup Firebase
- [Create project iOS project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
- You can import database by import.json from Firebase_Database directory.
